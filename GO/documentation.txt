go help can give all the commands to get more information about the commands
go env GOPATH is used to know the enviornment path of the go compiler
the job of teh lexer is to see that the user who is writing the piece of code is typing the correct syntax not missing anything(are you following the rules or not)
types:
case insensitive: almost
it can also be used to define wheather you are gonna use the variable in public or private
variable type should be known in advance
evrything is a type(regular types: String, bool, Integer, Floating, Complex, advanced types: array, slices, maps, structs, pointers)
there is nothing like try and catch in the go programming language, the go programming language user comma separated functionality wherein if there is no errror the reader gives the value to the input variable else if there is an error the reader gives the value to the err variable
if one doesnt care about the error then they use _ instead of write a variable name like err which is also the case with the input, if one only cares about the error there is no need to use a variable like input just use _
Why chose go over other programming languages for web development?
the go programming language is very fast
the go programming language has extensive libraries which can be used by the programmer with ease without using third party applications
the go programming language is higher in simpliest as it is made keeping newbie learning and simpler syntax in mind it doent have inheritances and other things
It can be compiled with just a simple command on the same page so it is very easy to handle and multiple requests can be made very easily
it has a large number of cloud infrusture support systems like aws, google clound, azure 
compiled statically type
